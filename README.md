Created a simple social media network data structure where the user is called Buddy and the network is called BuddyLand.
A buddy can do the following activities:
  Add a buddy.
  Remove a buddy.
  See their number of buddy connections(Friends).
  Search for a buddy by their first or last name.


Important: 
The purpose of this project was just to work with graphs and data structure analysis, so I just created the class and not an actual running app.
The test folder is there to compare the performance of a SortedArrayList and a TreeSet, that's how the decision of which data structure to use was made.
